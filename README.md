Exploratory data analysis of the white wine dataset
This report explores a dataset containing quality and
attributes for approximately 4900 white wines. The dataset
is related to white variants of the Portuguese “Vinho Verde” wine [1].
The inputs include objective tests (e.g. PH values) and the
output is based on sensory data (median of at least 3 evaluations
made by wine experts). Each expert graded the wine quality
between 0 (very bad) and 10 (very excellent).
